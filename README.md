#***Implementation Of Single Packet network***:

----------
###*Abstract*:

----------


An integrated circuit (also referred to as an IC, a chip or micro chip) is a set of electronic circuits on small plate of 
semiconductor material which performs functions by controlling signals and using external memory. Two types of ICs are 
discussed in this study; system on chip (SoC) and network on chip (NoC). SoC is an integrated circuit that integrates all 
components of a computer or other electronic system into a single chip. On the other hand, NoC is a communication subsystem
on an IC, typically between intellectual property cores in a SoC. NoC technology applies networking theory and methods to 
on-chip communication and brings notable improvements over conventional bus and crossbar interconnections. NoC improves the
scalability of SoCs and the power efficiency. The objective of this study is to make data flow between processors and memory 
more efficient. The conventional bus and crossbar interconnections fabrics have slow data flow speeds in SoCs. In order to 
achieve this objective, firstly, a program will be written in Hardware Description language (VHDL) for implementation 
in simple networks. The complexity of the program will be augmented by increasing the number of data flows simultaneously and 
optimizing it to make better, faster and power efficient chips. NoC links can reduce the complexity of designing wires for
predictable speed, power, noise, reliability, etc., due to their regular, well-controlled structure. In conclusion, the 
performance and efficiency of multi core processors will be increased, which are the fundamental entities of most electronic
devices and systems.
